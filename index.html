              Hi! My name is Sheena Barnes, and I'm a self-taught web developer.
              I have a PhD in History, but I've always been interested in
              coding.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In fact, one of the chapters of my dissertation dealt with
              intelligence, more specifically, sixteenth-century coding and
              cipher practices in England and Ireland.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I began my coding journey in Fall 2023 and have been happily
              coding ever since!

          <h3>Here's a list of my technical and design skills:</h3>
          <p>
            I'm actively working on Meta's Back-End certification program, which
            focuses primarily on Python and SQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of the Back-End certification program, I'm also currently
            learning Next.js and Typescript.

          <h3>Sweet and Savory Restaurant</h3>
          <p>
            I love breakfast food, and I especially love eggs. So, when it came
            time to create a restaurant project, I had to go with breakfast as
            the cuisine.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Using Figma, I designed an app for a breakfast restaurant called
            "Sweet and Savory" which offers menu items for those who prefer
            sweet or savory breakfast foods.
